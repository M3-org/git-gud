## High Level

**Step 1. Mindset**

Think like a mad hacker scientist. Psyops your own brain through fashion if you struggle with this, get a dress shirt and tie and nice jacket from a store or for your vtuber avatar (search booth.pm).

Read [Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash)

**Step 2: Start a journal**

Get into the habit of making documentation along the way, it is the best way to scale one-self. You can use [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/) and track your progress as you learn for easy sharing - notes make it faster to receive help and can become useful community contributions too.

**Step 3: Make stuff**


## Make avatar

1. Create an avatar using vroid studio https://vroid.com/en/studio
2. Customize the clothing
3. Export 2 versions: high quality and more optimized VRM of your vroid

Search around vtuber youtuber for advanced tips

## 3D scan

Photogrammetry guide: https://rd.nytimes.com/projects/an-end-to-end-guide-to-photogrammetry-with-mobile-devices
Easier: https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/tutorial-meshroom-for-beginners/


Get a camera and 3D scan something, can be an environment or object
Export 3D model and upload somewhere (sketchfab is fine)


## Blender

1. Download blender https://www.blender.org/
2. Download VRM plugin https://github.com/saturday06/VRM_Addon_for_Blender
3. Import your VRM into blender
4. Optimize it further

or

Optimize your 3D scan:

- cleanup loose geometry
- decimate without losing much quality
- Export as glTF

Then optimize the textures:

- convert png to jpg
- compress the textures without losing much quality

Take note of before and after with screenshots or clips, triangle count, and file size
Finally, convert glTF to glb: https://github.com/CesiumGS/gltf-pipeline

## Create world

https://github.com/msub2/awesome-webxr#frameworks-and-libraries

Make a virtual world in a webxr framework, [vrchat](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/setting-up-the-sdk), or [neosvr](https://neos.com/)

webxr recommendations: [janusweb](https://janusvr.github.io/guide/#/examples/markup) / [aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/)

Bonus if its in a multi-user avatar space

> Note: Can do [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com) for fun / practice, just know that you can't host it on the decentralized web

## Decentralized hosting

Check out https://fleek.co or https://pinata.cloud for ez mode IPFS hosting

### Bonus: ENS

(you'll need an ETH wallet for this step)

Buy an ENS address, point to the webxr experience with it

can use testnet if you don't wanna spend ETH

gj if you made it this far

## Promotion

Then make a 20-30 second sizzle video combining clips
